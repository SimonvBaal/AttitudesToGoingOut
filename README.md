In this project, we look at people's attitudes to going out during the pandemic.

The raw-data folder contains raw data, these may be cleaned by using the _cleaning files. Alternatively, the .RData file should have all the relevant data and analyses pre-loaded.
The data folder contains the data that rolls out after cleaning is finished. These datasets may be accessed and used through e.g. the analysis- scripts.

The _descriptives and _plots scripts are less interesting for reproducibility.

The analysis- scripts contain continuous ordinal regressions that take a long time to run. It is better to use RData to access the pre-run analyses directly.
